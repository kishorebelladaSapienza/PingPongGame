# PingPongGame
This Repo consists of my WEBGL ping pong game

The game can be played at : https://kishorebelladasapienza.github.io/PingPongGame/

The game consists of 2 html files, wherein index.html is mainly for accessing user inputs. After the user inputs, then gameStart.html is called, which is the file where the js is invoked and the game beings.

Hope you would enjoy the game.
